# Relyer 🐬
Relyer is a platform that helps MSMEs identify their tech needs, connecting with suppliers & experts that will boost their companies. We do a diagnostic test to measure and place the issues and improvements of the company related to digital transformation, and then we suggest specialists and tools according to the placement. You must register to access these features.
## -Test
Our entire platform has a water/sea topic. There is a "sea" of companies and entrepreneurs out there. That is why our representative character is a dolphin, which uses sonar systems to identify potential dangers and implements as food (test and experts). After you complete an approx. 5 minutes test you will be given a representative character and you will have a link to access recommended experts and tools.
## -Experts & Tools
Discover multi-disciplinary specialists and tools and choose the ones that best fit your needs, we expect to keep growing our resources and content to teach how to use diverse tools for your business
## -Learn more
